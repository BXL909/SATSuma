Version history
0.8 Initial release

SATSuma (for Windows) is a Bitcoin explorer, Xpub viewer, Bitcoin & Lightning dashboard with the option to create encrypted bookmarks and notes for addresses, blocks, xpubs and transactions, view network, on-chain and market charts or use as a 'watch-only' wallet.

SATSuma can connect to either your own full node (running Electrs/Fulcrum and mempool.space) or to the public mempool.space API. Xpub queries are restricted to the user's own node only, to maximise privacy. Keys to unlock encrypted bookmarks are not stored anywhere and are unrecoverable.

SATSuma comes with a handful of themes but it is also possible to create your own, by customising the colours of all elements and applying your own 'skin' or background image.

All user data is stored in two files (SATSuma_bookmarks.json & SATSuma_themes.json) stored in your user application data folder (e.g. C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\SATSuma).

SATSuma is completely free and open source. If you like it and want to support the project it would be hugely appreciated.
